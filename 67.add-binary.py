# Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string.
#
#
# Example 1:
# Input: a = "11", b = "1"
# Output: "100"
# Example 2:
# Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
# Output: "10101"
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10^4
# a and b consistÂ only of '0' or '1' characters.
# Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.
