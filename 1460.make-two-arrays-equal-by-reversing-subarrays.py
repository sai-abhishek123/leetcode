# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,4]\n[2,4,1,3]'
#
# You are given two integer arrays of equal length target and arr. In one step,
# you can select any non-empty subarray of arr and reverse it. You are allowed
# to make any number of steps.
#
# Return true if you can make arr equal to targetÂ or false otherwise.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: target = [1,2,3,4], arr = [2,4,1,3]
# Output: true
# Explanation: You can follow the next steps to convert arr to target:
# 1- Reverse subarray [2,4,1], arr becomes [1,4,2,3]
# 2- Reverse subarray [4,2], arr becomes [1,2,4,3]
# 3- Reverse subarray [4,3], arr becomes [1,2,3,4]
# There are multiple ways to convert arr to target, this is not the only way to
# do so.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: target = [7], arr = [7]
# Output: true
# Explanation: arr is equal to target without any reverses.
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: target = [3,7,9], arr = [3,7,11]
# Output: false
# Explanation: arr does not have value 9 and it can never be converted to
# target.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# target.length == arr.length
# 1 <= target.length <= 1000
# 1 <= target[i] <= 1000
# 1 <= arr[i] <= 1000
