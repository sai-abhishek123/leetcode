#
# Alice has n candies, where the i^th candy is of type candyType[i]. Alice
# noticed that she started to gain weight, so she visited a doctor.
#
# The doctor advised Alice to only eat n / 2 of the candies she has (n is
# always even). Alice likes her candies very much, and she wants to eat the
# maximum number of different types of candies while still following the
# doctor's advice.
#
# Given the integer array candyType of length n, return the maximum number of
# different types of candies she can eat if she only eats n / 2 of them.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: candyType = [1,1,2,2,3,3]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: Alice can only eat 6 / 2 = 3 candies. Since there are only 3
# types, she can eat one of each type.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: candyType = [1,1,2,3]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Alice can only eat 4 / 2 = 2 candies. Whether she eats types
# [1,2], [1,3], or [2,3], she still can only eat 2 different types.
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: candyType = [6,6,6,6]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: Alice can only eat 4 / 2 = 2 candies. Even though she can eat 2
# candies, she only has 1 type.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# n == candyType.length
# 2 <= n <= 10^4
# nÂ is even.
# -10^5 <= candyType[i] <= 10^5
#
