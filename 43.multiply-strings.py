#
# Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return
# the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.
#
# Note: You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs
# to integer directly.
#
#
# Example 1:
# Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
# Output: "6"
# Example 2:
# Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
# Output: "56088"
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 200
# num1 and num2 consist of digits only.
# Both num1 and num2 do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0
# itself.
